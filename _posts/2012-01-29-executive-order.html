		  <h1>Chicago Open Data Executive Order</h1>
		  <p>On December 10, 2012, Mayor Rahm Emanuel issued <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/narr/foia/open_data_executiveorder.html">Executive Order 2012-2</a> to codify his commitment to open data. The order requires each city agency to make reasonable efforts to publish all appropriate datasets and associated metadata under such agency's control to the data portal.</p>
		  <p>The executive order establishes an Open Data Advisory Group comprised of Open Data Coordinators from each City department. The Open Data Advisory Group assists the Chief Data Officer and Department of Innovation and Technology in creating the Open Data Annual Report.</p>
		  <p>The City of Chicago's inaugural technology plan outlines several key objectives. First, continue to release more data to the public as part of creating a more efficient government. Second, expand the use of social and digital media to communicate with the public. Finally, consolidate local IT services to improve efficiency and quality of delivery.</p>
		<p>Using the aforementioned objectives, the City of Chicago will increase the presence of open data through the following key initiatives: 
		  <ul>
			<li>The City will continue to publish 311 call types to provide a deeper perspective on service requests made by Chicago's residents.</li>
			<li>The City will target the publication of at least 25 more datasets in the upcoming year, which are enumerated in this report.</li>
			<li>When contracting for goods or services that will generate data, the City will identify publishable datasets and metadata at the outset.</li>
			<li>The City will used advanced analytical techniques to identify frequently-requested data to target for the release on the open data portal.</li>
			<li>The portal will contain a new, public method to solicit suggestions for new datasets.</li>
			<li>The City will create and maintain a new Open Data Status Blog to provide detailed to portal users.</li>
