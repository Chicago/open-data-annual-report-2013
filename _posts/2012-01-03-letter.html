      <p>The growth of the data portal has been exciting for those in government and the entire city. There are a number of large, notable datasets that residents, programmers, and journalists have frequently used, such as employee salaries, crime, permits, and payments. Through open data, Chicago has been able to serve residents in the 21st Century. Whether it's exploring <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/energymap">energy usage</a> in your community, when to move your car for street sweeping, or where to get a flu shot.</p>
               
      <p>Yet, the data portal is still young. There is still more data that has yet to be published. This document lays out Mayor Emanuel's initiatives to further the open data movement in Chicago and foster an open government. We must continue to set higher expectations for ourselves and serve the people, to whom this data belongs.</p>

      <p>The foundation for Chicago's open government policy is the passionate civic developer and good government communities. The engagement between community and government must continue to grow, beginning with this report. Which datasets would you like to see on the portal? How can the portal be changed to improve usability?  These questions and your suggestions will be vital to helping further open data.</p>

      <p>We encourage you to provide us your suggestions and feedback. Get in touch with us at <a href="mailto:dataportal@cityofchicago.org">dataportal@cityofchicago.org</a> or @ChicagoCDO. We look forward to working together on opening Chicago's government to the world.</p>
